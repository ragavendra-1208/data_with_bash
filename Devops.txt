Devops:
Section-1: Introduction:
Motive: Complete CI / CD Pipeline Going to Build. 

Git  (Local Version control system)
GitHub (Distributed Version control system)
Jenkins (Continuous Integration tool) 
Maven (Build tool)
Ansible  (Configuration management & Deployment tool) 
Docker  (For containerization) 
Kubernetes ( Container management tool) 

We are going to setup all these in AWS . 
***
We are going to Deployment in three places.  1) VM   2)Docker  3) Kubernetes

---Build and Deploy in Tomcat server:
Setup  CI/CD with GitHub, Jenkins, Maven and Tomcat 
Refer the Screenshots further. 
**
CI/CD 
Continuous Integration  
Continuous Delivery  = Need to get Approval manually after doing Deployment in the Staging. 
Continuous Deployment = Automatically deploying in Stage, prod . 

Note: Once if the Artifacts are developed by the jenkins (with the help of Maven) , it is copied to Ansible.  It will put the code in Kubernates. 
Also it will create the Image & push in the Docker hub.

Resources to Setup Devops CI/CD Pipeline:
1) AWS account 
2) Own GitHub
